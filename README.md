Executive Summary: 
This project presents a structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a global life expectancy dataset using SQL. 
The analysis focuses on identifying long-term trends, structural differences between country groups, and key socioeconomic drivers of life expectancy.

Dataset Overview: 
The dataset contains country-level annual observations with demographic, economic, and health indicators.

Data Preparation & Quality Control: 
- Removed duplicate country–year records
- Imputed missing life expectancy values using country-level averages
- Standardized categorical fields
- Validated numeric ranges

Analytical Objectives: 
1. Global life expectancy trends
2. Differences between developed and developing countries
3. GDP and life expectancy relationship
4. Impact of adult mortality

Key Insights: 
- GDP improves life expectancy but with diminishing returns
- Adult mortality is a strong predictor of life expectancy
- Developing countries are closing the gap faster

Tools & Skills: 
SQL (MySQL), Data Cleaning, EDA, CTEs, Aggregations
